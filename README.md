# deps-infer

Infer mvn deps from sources.

## Status

Proof of concept, subject to change. Improvements welcome!

## Use cases

This tool can be used to:

- Make implicit deps explicit
- Check which deps you are _not_ using by comparing the output with your existing `deps.edn`
- Port a `lein` `project.clj` or `boot` `build.boot` to `deps.edn`
- Port scripts (e.g. [babashka](https://github.com/babashka/babashka)
scripts) to a `deps.edn` project.
- Migrate from git deps to mvn deps
- Check if there is a newer version available

## Run

``` clojure
$ clojure -M deps-infer.main
```

This will index your `.m2/repository` and will analyze your sources under `src`
and `test`.

After that it will suggest a list of dependencies that you can add to your
`deps.edn`. It will always pick the newest version that is available in your .m2
repo.

For this project it will print:

``` clojure
babashka/fs {:mvn/version "0.0.1"}
clj-kondo/clj-kondo {:mvn/version "2021.02.14-SNAPSHOT"}
org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.3-rc1"}
org.clojure/clojurescript {:mvn/version "1.10.773"}
org.clojure/tools.cli {:mvn/version "1.0.194"}
version-clj/version-clj {:mvn/version "2.0.1"}
```

## CLI options

- `--repo`: The location of the mvn repo
- `--analyze`: The file, directory or directories of sources to analyze. You can
combine multiple files and directories using the OS-specific path separator:
`src:test`

## Possible improvements

PRs welcome.

- [ ] Do not suggest `SNAPSHOT` versions.
- [ ] The ClojureScript dependency is a false positive because it matched on
some of the namespace we use in this project.
- [ ] Download an index of all of Clojars for inferencing of deps that are not
      in your local `.m2/repository`. This index must be kept up to date,
      e.g. daily, and be committed to some git repo where we can then fetch it.
- [ ] Add warnings for unresolved namespaces

## Troubleshooting

To re-index your repo, remove the index of namespaces to jars, run:

``` bash
$ rm -rf .work/index.edn
```

and then run this tool again.
