# deps-infer

Infer mvn deps from sources.

## Status

Proof of concept, subject to change. Improvements welcome!

## Run

``` clojure
$ clojure -M deps-infer.main
```

This will index your `.m2/repository` and will analyze your sources under `src`
and `test`.

After that it will suggest a list of dependencies that you can add to your
`deps.edn`. It will always pick the newest version that is available in your .m2
repo.

For this project it will print:

``` clojure
babashka/fs {:mvn/version "0.0.1"}
clj-kondo/clj-kondo {:mvn/version "2021.02.14-SNAPSHOT"}
org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.3-rc1"}
org.clojure/clojurescript {:mvn/version "1.10.773"}
org.clojure/tools.cli {:mvn/version "1.0.194"}
version-clj/version-clj {:mvn/version "2.0.1"}
```

The ClojureScript dependency is a false positive because it matched on some of
the namespace we use in this project. This can be improved.

## CLI options

- `--repo`: The location of the mvn repo
- `--sources`: The directory or directories of sources to analyze. You can
combine multiple directories using the OS-specific path separator: `src:test`

## Troubleshooting

To re-index your repo, remove the index of namespaces to jars, run:

``` bash
$ rm -rf .work/index.edn
```

and then run this tool again.
